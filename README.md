Just a Fleet Schedulling Tool

### Setting up and Running
This app was made only with Python 3. Don't need any external libs to run:
```bash
python main.py
```
If you want to run the tests:
```bash
python test.py
```
Pay attention to the global variables in each file (`main.py` and `test.py`). This is the most you need to configure ;)
